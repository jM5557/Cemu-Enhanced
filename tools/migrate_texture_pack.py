"""
Rename a custom texture pack from the pre-discriminator hash scheme to the current one.

Why this is needed: the replacement lookup key used to be a plain content hash that ignored the
surface's dimensions and format, so two different textures of the same size could map to the same
pack entry and the wrong image would be applied. Folding those discriminators in fixes that, but
it changes every hash, and the hash is the filename.

Usage:
    1. Build with the fix, enable Debug > Dump > Textures, and play through the areas your pack
       covers. Every texture seen appends one line to <Cemu folder>/dump/textures/rename_map.csv.
    2. Dry run, then apply:
         python3 migrate_texture_pack.py dump/textures/rename_map.csv "load/textures/<titleId>/<pack>"
         python3 migrate_texture_pack.py dump/textures/rename_map.csv "load/textures/<titleId>/<pack>" --apply

Only the hash changes. Dimensions, format and mip index in the filename are preserved, so a file
that does not appear in the map is left alone and reported at the end.
